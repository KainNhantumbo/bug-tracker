# Bug Tracker Application (React + Typescript)

This is a **bug tracker application** built with React.JS and Typescript. To be short, the main goal here is to help developers to keep track of the software development bugs and issues, in a simple and more efficient way. You can find the API source code [here](https://github.com/KainNhantumbo/bug-tracker-api).

Finally, I just released the first stable version of the app. Has the development goes further I will be listing the introduced and new application features. For now, they are:

- This application is able to perform all CRUD operations to manipulate data to accomplish its purposes.

- Built from scratch, a custom, beautiful and clean user interface, all built powered with styled-components, and ofcourse, animations.

- Has more than just default dark and light themes, for now, there are 4 themes to choose, between light and dark themes. Uses the browser localStorage to save user theme preferences.

## Scripts for testing

Make sure you have installed **Node.js (v16.15.1 or later recommended) and also comes with npm**.\
In the project directory, you can run in terminal:

```bash
 npm run dev
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

```bash
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the **build folder**.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
